# QA Ltd DevOps DfE digital skills bootcamp, March 2022: Final project

<h3>Project Scope</h3>
<p>The scope of this project requires the trainee DevOps engineer to design and programme a simple object-oriented Python Flask app with HTML templates that integrates with a structured database. The database should exhibit Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality. Unit tests should test for integration as well as CRUD functionality. Once created, the app should be built automatically using a Jenkins pipeline script in the Jenkins automation server. Once successful, the app will deployed in a cloud-native development environment using Docker. Once the app image is built, it will run as a docker container with attributes gleanedd from the app's associated Dockerfile. Should this succed and the database data persist, it will be ready for multi-node deployment with Docker Swarm.</p>

<p> <strong>What this project does:</strong> This project consists of a Flask webapp designed to allow users to create a list of festivals they wish to attend, and add acts to the festival lineup in different timeslots.</p>

A series of epics were written on Jira consisting of user stories for the app user as well as the DevOps engineer over the course of <a href="https://rebekah-akingbala.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/QBAFA/boards/2/roadmap">two sprints</a>. Jira progress updates, comments, and task assignment were integrated into a number of <p><a href="https://rebekah-akingbala.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/QBAFA/code">Ruka257 GitHub Repos</a> using Smart Commits.</p>
